Text 1: The Second Wizarding War was a terrible catastrophe for the entire magical world. The number of people who died, how many lives were maimed... Some managed to recover mentally and physically, while for others, it was impossible. But May 2, 1998, will forever be etched in history. Ron Weasley was one of those people who managed to survive this nightmare. His wife, Hermione Granger, also did. The loss of his brother, Fred, haunted Ron, and he knew that he and his family would never fully recover from this trauma. Sometimes, it haunted him in nightmares. But today, for some reason, he saw a memory in his dream. It was a cold and unpleasant October back then. Ron and Hermione were walking through a construction store in search of paint for their bedroom. Granger, being more knowledgeable about the Muggle world, quickly noticed the right section. Naturally, Ron hurried after her. The young couple scrutinized the color palette with discerning eyes. They both noticed options that they would like. "Ron, look at this wonderful lilac! Agree, it's perfect for the bedroom?" "Hermione, what about this peach one? Don't you like it?" "Well, it's somewhat too pale..." "And lilac seems gloomy... Sweetheart, if you like it, we'll choose it, but..." "You're right, dear... Oh... I don't know what to choose then," the girl turned away disappointedly, shaking her luxurious chestnut hair slightly.

Text 2: Morning of the twenty-fifth of December in the most enchanting place in England. Outside, large snowflakes were falling, creating small glittering snowdrifts. Next to the beds of the young wizards, gifts were already lying, delivered by the house elves of Hogwarts during the night. Some received books, some decorations, some handmade sweaters, and someone got just a single napkin. The decision on what gift to give to their master was made by the elves themselves. However, those who received completely strange things discussed it with slight dissatisfaction with those who, for example, received at least socks for Christmas. Well, Christmas at Hogwarts! Vacation. The decorated School of Witchcraft and Wizardry created a festive atmosphere. Everyone wanted to hurry and join their families to celebrate this holiday. Harry kindly helped his friends pack. He, however, stayed at school. This time, the people remaining at Hogwarts for the holidays could be counted on one hand, including the teachers. "Are you sure you don't want to come celebrate with us?" Ron clarified before leaving the room. "Mom would be happy to see you..." "Yes," Potter said shyly and quietly, not wanting to dwell on this topic any longer. The Weasley family was hosting a full house of guests this year, and Harry didn't want to crowd them. There were only a few hours left until the departure of the Hogwarts Express. The last hugs with Hermione and Ron, before the start of classes, were accompanied by congratulations and good wishes. Somewhere deep down, Harry wished they could celebrate this Christmas together in Hogsmeade, but the understanding that his friends would like to be with their families was stronger. Time was flying by swiftly, just like the train that had departed a few minutes ago. The light sadness for friends and the feeling of loneliness dissipated on the evening of Christmas, spent in the Great Hall, already adorned with twelve enormous Christmas trees, decorated with garlands and candles. During the Christmas feast at Hogwarts, magical snowflakes fell from the enchanted ceiling. They didn't melt at all, and each one could be examined more closely. Harry liked the intricate patterns on the snowflakes. He watched with interest every one he managed to catch. The gaze of the young wizard caught the dance of the magical snowflakes. They seemed to lead him. Harry found himself in his room without even realizing it. A letter lay on the bedside table. Quickly opening it, Potter took out a small piece of paper and an amulet resembling a coin. The paper had only one word - "Save," written in a handwriting that was too familiar, a handwriting that Harry had seen hundreds of times. It was James Potter. The style of this young man would never be mistaken. An engraved train was on the bronze amulet. This train was not like the Hogwarts Express. It was gloomy, old, and completely untrustworthy. The coin shimmered, pulling Potter along. In just a few minutes, the boy stood in front of that very train. As if this amulet wanted to bring Harry here. Fate itself was telling him - "Save." What if his biological father really needed to be saved? What if this matter concerned the entire world? The coin led the wizard to the conductor's cabin. His eyes caught the round recess where the amulet fit perfectly. The train started moving in an instant; Harry didn't even have time to think about where it was leading and what kind of train it was. There was no way to escape now... His mind clouded. Harry woke up outside the train at the station. The surroundings were familiar, but the people around seemed like they were from another era. Melancholy hung in the air. The wizard took the letter from his pocket and reread its contents, remembering how he ended up here. However, when he turned to the railway tracks, he didn't see the train that likely brought him to this station. Harry remembered that vaguely. "Save..." he said aloud and quickly headed towards his old home. His breath was uneven; he was in a hurry. Potter didn't care how the letter was sent to him, given that his father had been dead for a long time, and what kind of express arrived and took him away. Right now, all that echoed in his mind was this "Save." From what? Why? When? It was warm in his house. Shadows of people were clearly bustling, preparing for Christmas. Maybe this was a miracle? Perhaps this was the Christmas when Harry could celebrate it with his family? Just one day... The boy quietly opened the door, forgetting even the courtesy of knocking, as thoughts of a family holiday took precedence. "Mum?... Dad?" he whispered, closing the door behind him.


Text 3: Harry lay on the bed. His vacant gaze barely registered the movements of a spider crawling across the uneven, dusty ceiling. Where was he? Why had he been transported here directly from the battle with the remnants of the Death Eaters? And what were those familiar voices coming from behind the door? He could clearly hear Aunt Petunia cooing at Dudley in the kitchen. He was back at the Dursleys', back in the cupboard. It was curious why Aunt Petunia was speaking so sweetly to her already grown-up son. Something else seemed strange to Harry, but he couldn't figure out what. He needed to get out of here. The Dursleys wouldn't be thrilled to see him, but there was nothing to be done. He just needed to quickly explain everything and escape while they were still in shock. Harry reached for his glasses, which were usually on the bedside table. Standing up, he bent down to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling, but suddenly realized that his body had become smaller. With just one look at himself, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in Britain understood that he was ten years old again. A lanky build, Dudley's old clothes hanging on him like a sack, and short stature. This wasn't right! He forcefully opened the door and burst into the kitchen. There was a pile of presents, and Uncle Vernon, with his still ungrayed mustache, disdainfully looked at his nephew over the morning newspaper. — Why are you dawdling? — he barked. — Since you're awake, go help Petunia with breakfast! Don't ruin the holiday for us. Holiday? Harry looked again at the pile of presents. Dudley's birthday! And there were only thirty-six presents in that heap. Is it all starting over again? Did he die on that mission and get a second chance? Then, during the trip to the zoo, he would be able to talk to that snake again. Even if he had to go through all the trials again, he was ready. Dudley entered the room. As expected, upon seeing the presents, he immediately asked how many there were. — Thirty-eight! — proudly replied Uncle Vernon. — We'll buy one more today when we go to the city. Dudley, with a satisfied face, started tearing the wrapping off a new watch. It hit Harry like a Bludger in the head. How... thirty-eight? Why was there no tantrum? — Why are you standing like a statue? — Aunt Petunia's high-pitched voice came from behind. — Get dressed quickly; I've prepared a costume for you. I can't leave you alone, so you'll come with us. Harry slowly turned to her. So, he was going after all? He overheard the adults talking yesterday that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, and now he would be able to go. Why yesterday? No, that conversation should have taken place this morning, after the present tantrum. — How long are you going to stare at me? — Uncle Vernon lost patience. — Get dressed quickly; guests have already arrived. And don't you dare embarrass me today! Harry quickly got dressed. He met Piers, Dudley's friend. On the way to the city, they taunted him, as expected. Then came the fruity ice cream. Only it wasn't lemon, but for some reason cherry-flavored. And then the zoo. But he still couldn't hear the snake's voices, and it didn't understand him either. On the way home, he pondered. He would find out everything tomorrow when the letter arrived. But the letter did not come. Not the next day, not the day after. Hagrid did not visit him on his eleventh birthday. Harry didn't go to Diagon Alley or Gringotts. And only on September 1st, crossing the threshold of "High Camerons" school, the Boy Who Lived, with tears in his eyes, admitted the obvious. It was just a dream.


Text 4: Theodore Nott had been eagerly awaiting his invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from the very beginning. He knew he was special, believed in it. He had always taken pride in his family. Theo grew up as an unassuming, calm, and intelligent child, but with a keen desire to achieve the best, clever enough. And, as the son of the Notts, how could he not end up in Slytherin? When he turned 11, he received the coveted letter to the wizarding school, and in September, after the sorting ceremony, he found himself in the Snake House. He liked everything about it: the aristocratic common room, most of his classmates (except Crabbe and Goyle), the head of the house, and the subjects. Theo developed a great fondness for Potions and Transfiguration, believing that they were essential for life and the future. Any subject could be transformed into what you desired. Pansy Parkinson also hailed from a pure-blood wizarding family. From childhood, she was told to look perfect, know how to flirt with men, and, above all, seek wealth. Pansy was very intelligent herself, but despite her beauty, she had apparently heard many different nicknames in kindergarten and elementary school. The most offensive was "Pug." Well, she didn't look like one; it was just a detail kids used for insults. But in Slytherin at Hogwarts, you wouldn't hear such things. Pansy understood from the first days that Draco Malfoy was obviously the best option for her, both as a friend and in hypothetical relationships. In the future, of course. She loved Ancient Runes and Divination; she enjoyed dueling and exploring aspects of the future. And runes were always interesting to lay out: you never knew what answer they would give, whether it would be Gebo with Wunjo or something else. The years passed, Theo and Pansy grew up. Now it was the fifth year, they were 15, the first exam... Now, instead of "Pug," the girl heard the occasional very quiet "slut," and Theo suddenly began to hear "womanizer," although he just preferred studying, didn't invest much in relationships, because grades for the O.W.L.s were much more important, so it never came to intimacy. So, initially, they judge based on appearance, and then they see an almost emotionless guy. And Pansy just got used to Draco, got used to the fact that he didn't care about her, just occasionally drank, but never allowed herself to kiss someone else or, worse, intimacy. Neither paid much attention to rumors, just lived and continued to prepare. And finally, all O.W.L.s were passed with grades above expectations, and the sixth year began. Theo and Pansy didn't interact much before, but they got along quite well. There was never any misunderstanding between them. And both occasionally noticed each other's successes and good qualities. One day, they both sat on the lawn in front of the castle. There was still an hour before classes; Transfiguration was supposed to be next. Theo had mastered non-verbal spells, so his cup easily turned into either a tangerine or a plate. • How do you manage that? - suddenly asked Parkinson. • She had problems with this Transfiguration spell. So, she definitely needed help, and Theo usually didn't refuse. • It's quite simple if you repeat not only the words and movements but also know what you want to get from the subject in the end. What it should be like, what smell, taste, color, textures... • Everything you say sounds so simple, - the girl sighed, - but I just can't... • Want me to prove that it's really easy? And also, - here Theo smiled, - a bright and beautiful girl, resembling a star, certainly won't mind having a reason to rejoice. Flowers for the lady? • The girl snorted. Clearly, he was flirting, but at the same time, it was beautiful, and he was teaching. • Okay, but the flowers should be worthy of me. • Of course, princess, - the guy looks for the nearest tree branch, finds it, takes it, frowns slightly, while imagining beautiful black orchids that would suit Pansy, - Orchideus, - Theo said, after which the wand from the branch turned into exactly the bouquet Nott wanted. He handed her the bouquet with a smile.


Text 5: A new professor from Japan arrived at Hogwarts School of Wizardry to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Nakamura was young, but strict enough to make all the students fear him and do all their homework. 
One day when Hermione, Harry and Ron were walking down the corridor of the farthest tower of the school, they met a man wearing a large and black hat. The man turned out to be a follower of Voldemort and tried to kill Harry Potter. But suddenly, Professor Nakamura came out of the corner and did battle with the man in the hat. The man in the hat used dirty tricks and knocked the teacher's wand out of his hands and it rolled down the stairs. But the battle didn't end there and despite the fact that Professor Nakamura was left without a magic wand, he used his karate skills and defeated the man in the hat without any magic. After that, Professor Nakamura won the hearts of all the female students at Hogwarts. However, the appearance of the man in the hat was not just …
